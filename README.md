Embarking on a five-week journey with the **IBADAN POWER PLATFORM COMMUNITY** has been an enriching experience, culminating in a real-world application of our newfound Power BI skills. The community generously provided us with a dataset, challenging us to unleash the potential of data analytics and draw meaningful insights.

## Introduction
The provided dataset was given to us by the **Ibadan Power Platform Community.** The dataset encompasses crucial information such as order details, customer demographics, product specifics, and sales data. This project serves as the culmination of our training, allowing us to practically apply our newfound knowledge and create tangible, data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
1. What is the total sales made yearly since 2015? Has sales been on the increase since over the years?
2. Which of the segments, categories and regions make the highest sales?
3. Where does our Customers reside?
4. In which year do we have the highest and least order? etc.

## Data Sourcing
Upon formulating the aforementioned questions, the next step involved procuring the requisite dataset for analysis. Utilizing the provided problem statement as a guideline, I obtained the dataset from the Ibadan Power Platform Community. This dataset, meticulously prepared and shared by the community, encapsulates pivotal information encompassing order details, customer demographics, product specifics, and sales data.

To commence the data sourcing process, I navigated to the designated source and downloaded the dataset in CSV format. Following this, I extracted the CSV file into Power BI, a robust data analysis and visualization tool. This facilitated seamless integration of the dataset into a dynamic analytical environment, enabling comprehensive exploration and interrogation of the data.

## Data Transformation/Cleaning
The Data was pre-efficiently cleaned. I did no data cleaning.

## Data Modeling
The dataset contains only a table, So, No modeling is needed
